# TEMPEST IONIC STRENGTH EXPERIMENT

We conducted lab-based experiments to test the hypothesis that “The release of DOM from upland soils following exposure to saline waters will become elevated in response to a decrease in soil porewater ionic strength resulting from subsequent saturation with freshwater from rain events”. 
Soil collected from an untreated area of the TEMPEST site was exposed to a gradient of salinities ranging from distilled water (DI) water to seawater (100% Artificial Seawater (ASW)). Following exposure to the salinity gradient, the soil was repeatedly washed with DI water (simulating subsequent rain events). After each wash, the soil solutions were centrifuged and the supernatants filtered. The filtrates were measured for pH, conductivity, major cation concentrations, DOC, CDOM, and DOM molecular mass and polydispersity by HPSEC.
